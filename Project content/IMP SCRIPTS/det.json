    'comments': ["The game itself is a great concept, and executed well. The community is still quite active(what, 4, 5 years later?) and is updated frequently. The issue is that there are a few really bad bugs.(I'll only be able to talk about one bug due to text limit :) ) This has only happened during the last week or so, where 4/5 times that I attempt to log in it stops at the very end. Then I have to exit out of the app and retry. This sometimes has taken up to 25 MINUTES to finally get a time where it works.", 'I have enjoyed the game for years and still give the concept 5 stars. But the recent update highlights the long-term technical issues. I personally am unhappy about splitscreen no longer being supported as this makes coordinating raids with my friends impossible. Pvp is still full of bugs and cheaters. Lately while booting the app it will crash and log me out. (This still occurs after following troubleshooting instructions.) I would like to play a solid game,not just a "cool" one.', "5/12: crashes when i switch between screens, find 3. It's a really fun game and I enjoy the aspect of going out for more than just a breath of fresh air. However, I'm on a Galaxy fold 3 common I find this game crashes quite often. What I mean is that it doesn'tfully load when I open it. I've tried for stopping it, clearing cache, and even then it's hit or miss.", 'Fun in the city but CONSTANG UPDATES.Every like four weeks or so I can\'t open the app because it needs to update and in the passed It wasn\'t too annoying but lately every update requires like 1gb or more. It\'s like come on! Give me a break. Not only that but the updates aren\'t even worth it. don\'t know anyone who usesthat "notebook" where you save locations and what not that people send or you find. Like no benefit. Yet I still play because it\'s highly addictive and I am super competitive.', "I really love this game, but since the latest update it's been impossible to play. Takes 2-4 tries to even get past the loading splash and freezes + crashes at the slightest provocation (attempting to open News, Special Research, Gyms, trainer profileetc.) I know I'm not the only one having these issues across a wide variety of device & OS, so I'm very disappointed that this update has been out for weeks and these problems haven't been addressed. I'll improve my review and rating when they are.", "Shoutout to the dev team for makingIncenses USELESS by lowering the standing spawn rate SEVENTY FREAKING PERCENT. Now I'm incensed. Congrats! Also the memory requirements for this game have become absurd. Some of the features have been de-bloated, but it isn't enough. Also also, AR at startup should be opt-in rather thanopt-out. The popup doesn't do jack as far as turning it off. Fix that. I will continue to use this, but I'm not spending any (more) money untilthese issues are fixed.", "I never played cause they didn't have battles. After doing a few, spamming one attack is counterintuitive and empty.Now that I played more of game, I hope past Pokevents(ha) return(ha). Battles still suck, an attack with a QTE should have 1 or 2 perks to compensate, such as super armor or invisibility frames. charge attacks are useless if you die before getting a chance to fire", 'I used to love thisgame, but the previous updates broke it and the developers refuse to fix it or acknowledge any problems. Instead they blame it on user error. UPDATE: I can now log in after 2 weeks, thanks to the latest update, but the server lag is AWFUL and makes it hard to do much. But at least I canplay again, sort of. I wish I could be compensated for the loss of progress, but I doubt it. Updated rating to 3 stars.', "I love this game, I've spent hundreds of dollars already over the past 5+ years... Unfortunately, I'm leaving this 1* review because the in the latest update, Niantic got rid of pop-up view/split screen. I used this mode to keep stats, infographics, and whatever else I needed up on the screen and out of theway. I'm very disappointed because of this, and I'm now dissuaded from playing this game. I don't have the motivation to play anymore. I'll delete this review if/when it ever gets fixed.", "Really glitchy.... The graphics are not good too .... It is really basic, same backgrounds and other designs are still the same. The Asian company doesn't even bother changing the designs after 6 years. The NEWS are saying, that they are using the game as a counter terrorism organization app. They are using locations, physical activity, different land mapping, Google maps, phone storage and more. As soon as you download the game, you are granting permission of the app into your phone. Beware!!", "Personally, I (usually) love this game. Until recently, I'd get on twice a day or so and use the game to it's fullest potential. However after the last update, I'm in the game but 10 seconds and it crashes, kicking me out of the app. The game has crashed before, but never so many times in a row. Maybe my phone is just bad, but this and several other bugs hinder the otherwise amazing experience.", "I really enjoy this game, but since the latest update, it takes 2-3 tries to actually get the app to start. Sometimes I have to reboot my phone just to get the app to fully open; otherwise it gets stuckon the loading screen. Additionally, if I start the app while connected to WiFi, then switch to data, it hangs (and the white Poke ball spins in the upper left corner). It's quite frustrating, especially since the previous version started up fairly quickly. Please fix!", "Fun enough to keep around on my phone. Been playing it since around the time it released, but there's been very little change in regards to gameplay over the years, and at a point you hit a severe wall with leveling and gaining items. At one point it just becomes a straight up grind and it's no longerthe sort of game I go out of my way to play, I just turn it on when my friends play it.", 'Why half the interaction distance with health concerns still high? Doubling the distance was a great idea. It helped with several misplaced pokestops in my area that are an accessible due to misplacement or closed access. People do silly things sometimes to get to some of these stops. I did not see that happening in the last year. This decision should be reversed with a rise in the d variant. The interactive distance is too small.', "Overall experience with the game personally has been much better recently compared to a few years ago. Definitely noticing more crashes with this update though. One crash cost me a raid and remote raid pass that I paid for. Obviously it's not the biggest issue, but if I'm willing to put money into a mobile game and I lose what I paid for in-game because of YOUR update, then I feel like the game should be able to replace what's lost during the crash. Just something to consider for your customers.", "Used to be more of a tech demo.... But still fun to play with. Nowadays there's a real game here with the excellent pvp battle league - it's definitely got a learning curve, but it really does give me a reason to catch them all. Also there are often interesting events going on. Very entertaining, makes the game fresher. In app purchases aren't too pay to win. Time, location, and brains are the biggest factors. I hope they continue to put the work in to make the game great!", 'I think there are a lot of areas (6414) in the game to where they canbe improved or altered a tad bit. For instance the way the gift dangles in front the screen (2342) is annoying and gets in the way when you aretrying to click on something. Next, there should be a way to click on multiple FRIENDs (7530) and send numerous gifts out at once instead of having to sit around and do it one by one. This is just 2 of my pet peeves I have against the game to make it not get 5 stars. Ghopper85', "The app is very stable and basically never crashes or has connection issues compared to when I first started playing. With the changes made since the pandemic it's now a lot easier to play whenever without needing to sit in an urban area near a ton of PokeStops, which is great. The main problem is they keep pushing AR mode and have completely ruined buddies by getting rid of the old mode that actually worked.", "The game is great! It's fun to play, the controls are easy, the graphics and sound are amazing, and there are no ads! That said, if it is your only exposure to the Pokémon franchise, please know that it is nothing like the canon games (that's right, I don't consider it canon- that's how different it is)! My only complaint is that it can be pretty laggy sometimes!", "I love the game however recently the game hasn't been loading pass the watch out for object around you screen. The moment I touch the screen the game closes out. I tried to uninstall and reinstall hoping it would work but it hasn't. I don't know if it's a bug. Hopefully it will be fixed soon I don't want to stop playing a game I had for a long time. I love my Eevee and evolutions especially Vaporeon.", "Game is a fun idea, poorly executed on anything other than apple. I want to play with my friends but the difference in quality is too great. Don't make the game for multiple platforms if it's only optimized for one. Used increased distances to help with COVID restrictions and pulled them back, regardless of the pandemic still raging. Unethical and unprofessional.", "Even with updates, there's a lot of issues regarding both the gameplay and battle league. It might be my phone or whatnot but how is it possible for the other side to wipe the floor with me by launching two charged attacks almost a minute one after the other. It's nothing to do with my mobile services and honestly, it's rather irritating unless charged attacks have instantaneous charge time (which seems BS regardless) - something is not genuine about that. Otherwise, good for getting up more.", "I've been enjoying this game for almost 2 years now, however I have encountered a few issues 1. The gameis unusually laggy right now, and freezes somewhat often. 2. On my phone, the game simply will not update, I have to delete it and reinstall itagain in order to apply updates. Other than that, the game is very fun, however until there issues are fixed my rating will be lowered to 3 stars.", "I was recently recommended this game by a friend. It started off fun for the most part, but through progressing and reading reviews of what this game, it became a bit of a disappointment. I love Alolan Pokémon, but I haven't been able to catch many or evolve any with the small amount of Candies given each time you catch one. That is IF you can catch one. They're super difficult to catch. Even with a berry and a curveball throw with a Great Ball, it's hard. Running out of Pokéballs is also easy.", "Very good game, only 2 things I don't like, I don't live near pokestops (just delt a bad hand). And also I was wondering if there could be a switch that let you show up on other peoples screens, It can help friends find eachother and find a new person to battle. Edit: lots of the charechters fall apart, only a small graphical glitch", "The app has beenpretty much broken for a while now. It takes several tries for me to get in and even then the app is slow, unresponsive, and sometimes freezes my whole phone and then crashes anyways. I can't even listen to music while I play anymore, it makes the game lag terribly. Usually it shuts offmy music and then crashes itself. No amount of restarting my phone or refreshing the game data helps. I really did enjoy the game but it's beena nightmare lately and it's not worth the headache.", "First off, I really enjoy this game. Have been playing for almost 4 years. But it's turned into trash with every update, and the game is virtually unplayable due to constant crashes and failing to even start. I initially gave it 4 stars cause they couldn't get their server issues figured out. I'm lowering it to 1 star cause they haven't improved it, they've made it worse. Maybe they can put the millions a year of profits into making a game that can be played, I'll play again.", "I have the hardest time with this game. For the most part it's fun but the grind is really high especially if you play this more for a collector status vs. a someone who likes to battle, which cause an annoying pay to play senario. Not to mention it's a really buggy app, 9 out of 10 it has a very hard time launching. It crashes and it slows down all the time. I really hope they make this game better in the future but for now I guess I wait so much time grinding uselessly until then, I guess.", "Sometimes it works well, other times it constantly crashes. Also, when their game keeps messing up and you lose items that you had to pay for, they will only reimburse your items so many times. It doesn't matter if their game keeps crashing, they don't want you refunded. I stopped spending any money on coins because of this.", "Wish I could give zero stars. I'm getting sick of uninstalling and reinstalling after every little update just because the developers are apparently incompetent. Seems to be a recurring issue otherwise I'd be more understanding and forgiving. It would be nice to be able to open the app in less than 3 attempts every time... unfortunately Niantic doesn't seem to care about the players, just the money", "The latest update has caused a lot of issues for me. It's slow to start, and sometimes it stays on the start up screen for 5 minutes with no change. It'll take up to 4 tries to actually load the game. Not only that, incense being nerfed was the biggest mistake they can ever make. There's still a pandemic!", "Love the concept. Can be pretty jank, but fun. Things I hate: Gatekeeping certain objectives around the 'friends' feature. Not realistic to know/meet people around this game and therefore cannot complete certain objectives - currently 8 quests locked out. The sheer randomness can override what's 'fair'. Can feel super arbitrary. Huge waste of time/resources when stuff doesn't work like it should. Raid lobbies don't work half the time - non participation a huge problem, waste of resources.", "A pretty good time killer every once in a while. My only real complaints are the slow player progression and poor loading times. Granted, I don't exactly have the best phone, so load times could be a me issue. The game can get pretty tiresome after a week or so, but never boring enough for me to consider uninstalling.", "Really fun concept, but there's a lot of bugs that ruin the experience. Scrolling through captured Pokemon is a nightmare, as it frequently shoots all the way to the bottom of the list when scrolling slowly and normally. Please fix this, as it's not a problem in any other app I've ever used.", "I really don't want to hate this game, but it's extremely difficult. The battle league (or Battle Lag, as I like to call it), is infuriating and raids tend to be buggy as well. Furthermore, in recent months it seems as though it's become significantly more pay to win. Niantic has made some minor changes after the uproar, but it's still becoming a game that very much favors the fat wallet. It can be fun, at times, but the bad moments are starting to outnumber the good ones.", 'Pokémon Go is a great premise and I have enjoyed playing it since it came out. When the pandemic hit and the distance to stops and Pokémon was increased to help allow more people to play safely, my game experience massively improved. Niantic has now reversed the spinning distance back from 80 m spinning distance to 40 m which greatly limits my ability to play the game effectively. Please put it back. Update: Niantic listened to the fan base and permanently changed to 80 m. Thank you!', 'Always a bit buggy (hence 4 stars), but always a good time. This game kept me up and moving through the pandemic and still holds my attention daily even after playing it for the past few years. The continual events and new content really make it easy to keep going especially Battle League.Definitely comes recommended for social playing as well, PoGo is a lot more fun with friends especially if you live rurally (raids can be difficult even with remote passes).', 'I am revising to a 1 star from a 4 star. Protesting the changes to pokestops and gyms in the game. The changes, while for the pandemic, i have found them to be a massive QOL improvement to the game that resulted in my spending more time playing the game outside of events. I have probably spent more time (and actual money) playing in the last year vs the previous 4 combined. I am dissapointed by this reversion & apparent lack of interest in feedback from the global community this QOL improved', "I recently got back into the game and was surprised to see that the range of poketops has been increased. It was a very necessary change for a lot of reasons like: safer to interact withPokestops and gyms, being able to interact with off limits places that can't be entered without permission and so much more. With the latest update they reverted the range to how it used to be. Now I can't access a lot of places near by without trespassing or having to go out of my way to interact with the stop.", "So almost everything is great about this game, but there are definitely bugs that seem to not be addressed. For example, I get the task to scan a PokeStop. When I'm in range to scan, the button to scan refuses to appear, but when I'm out of range of the stop, the scan button shows up but tells me to move closer. It's so broken I have never scanned a single stop (even after making it all the way to level 38). Despite the bugs, it's still a fun little game, just not worth investing money into."],
