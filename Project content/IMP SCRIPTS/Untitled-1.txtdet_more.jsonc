    'comments': ["It's a totally awesome game. Graphics are insanely good, and gameplay is intuitive and realistic. I have a few suggestions: Helicopters should be able to fly in 3D mode as well, and also repair and reload in the air over their base ship. I think ships that aren't aircraft carriers should have a limited number of helicopter refills, however. There should also be an option to play the game while disconnected from the internet, and store progress on the device until it's back online.", "It is a very fun game. It's definitely much different from other shooter games (in a good way) I like how it takes so long to kill enemies, it just makes each fight more suspensful and exciting. It is as good, if not, better, than other shooter games. Although I don't like how people just spam a bunch of aircraft carriers and planes, so if many it was easier to lock on to aircrafts with canon's like the Korkit D or whatever.", "The game is great. It's like a modern version of world of warships. One thing I wish is that the extra aircraft that they show in the ship buying screen that show up on the Aircraft Carriers were there inthe battle. It would make the ascetic of the ship look better and make it more realistic. Other than that, great game.", 'You guys have done anamazing job with this but I feel like there could be some changes. First of all I feel like we should have a larger selection of ships and weapons. We could use ships from smaller countries especially. 2nd of all we could use more maps for sure. Last but not least, we could also use more modes such as capture flag or something like that. Other than that, keep up the great work on the game and amazing job!', "Awesome graphic andgreat gameplay. Controls are good. I think the game needs more maps. And when flying helicopters at 100kmh bombs down just drop straight down. You need to fix that. To all new players, just try it. It's easy and unlike other game you can do a lot without spending a looney", 'I give it 4for now. The game is cool, graphics and sound is good but it constantly closes and logs me out in the middle of a game. Sometimes every game for 4 or 5 in a row. Been doing that for a week now. Also there needs to be button to equip your ship with a new weapon when you purchase it. Tookme several days to figure it out.', 'This is a amazing game. I have played it for a couple of months and love it. I have 2 suggestions. Number 1 is realistic aircraft. I love aircraft carriers and would love it if the aircraft would use the catapults to take off and a option to land a squadron and the planes using the arresting wires to land. Number 2 is bigger maps. I have a problem where when I use my aircraft carrier I almost always find my self getting found and attacked and dying. It takes away the long range view of carriers.', 'its a pretty good game, fairly good at balancing the matches when fighting offline. when battling online, not so much. as a level 7 player, it had put me in a match against several level 20 players, with much more powerful ships. once you get to level 5, there is a pretty big gap of ships, as you can by some ships, but need to reach level 15 before you can get any new ones. some new ships at level 10 would be nice to have, and maybe some new contries, such as Sweden, Germany, and France.', "So I have made past reviews on this game saying it's amazing. Which it is. Just some small suggestions you should change the water physics to some maps. The waves on the new Iceland map are amazing but the water fazes through the back of the ship. Also the Yamato and Missouri are to expensive. I would put them at 25 dollars max. I would save the 75 dollar options for things like unlocking all ships or for top top tier ships like the last few.", 'Ngl, this the best mobile warship game out there. The graphics are awesome, the ships look good,and the new map and monthly changes make it so much better than the average mobile war game. Suggestion for the developers: I think a lot of people would like it if there were more t3 destroyers, another assault carrier, and another map or two. Thanks!', "I really like this game but manit freezes my phone so hard. I can't use chat in battle, using carrier class ship is almost impossible sometimes, it crashes frequently. I haveall my settings on low and still changes nothing. I play lots of other games with high, real time graphics and don't experience this so much. Wish it ran smoother on my device, but great game so far.", 'I love dis game. The graphics are good. U don\'t have to pay for ammo, it\'s beginner freindly, it\'s ez to get money and prices are cheaply good. One improvement you could make is xp. It takes so long and you earn about 0.5% ofxp bar every battle. And if you want the game to be easy to get stuff done quick, you can play offline. Then there is "kill stealing" it shouldbe more damage, your kill. Bc ships are not easy to kill. And I do appreciate that you get earnings on damage instead of kills.👍', "Awesome Game. Very well implemented. I would like to suggest a just one thing. The Daily missions are overwhelming I have to spend to much time in the gameto complete them. They do give you 24 hrs, but even thou I sleep 8 work 12 that's 4 hours to complete. I just think lower the cost of completion of each task or something that can make squeeze another star in this post. Thanks in advance team.", "Overall, a pretty enjoyable game. Graphics & sounds are good. A few details irk me, but probably unnoticed by most. Not as pay-to-win as some other games. It's still there but tolerable if you're willing to fight AI, until you're built up & ready. Playing for free or cheap can drag things out considerably. However, with a planof daily goals, I've been able to keep going without burning out too often. Premium & Vip only worth it if you play & complete daily goals, every single day", "Pretty cool game, good graphics, and nice looking ships, but I have a problem with the game. I paid for 15 levels of the battlepass, got my VIP stuff delivered fine along with everything else, except the one thing I really wanted was the Admiral Panteleyve destroyer at level six. I really don't understand why I didn't get it, but it's nowhere to be found, and can't seem to get an administrator to talk to. Otherthan that it's really fun", "Game is pretty good. Matchmaking is quick, and online play is tiered. So even if you are new and in tier 1, and facing lvl 40s, they can only use t1 ships in t1 battles too. Tons of customization. My only quips are that it's hard to make friends and get in aclan, and leveling up is quite the grind. Chat isn't particularly friendly, but it's not unique to this game of course, and I don't fault the game design for it. I do think the grind could be a lil quicker though.", "Everything was fantastic. Probably the best mobile game I've ever played. But... something happened to the framerate. I can no longer get more than half-a-dozen frames per game. That's right. Five or six frames in 10 minutes. I factory reset my phone, and installed this app only. No difference. Less than one frame per minute. Audio comes through just fine.I can hear the entire battle going on around me, but I am unable to participate. This is while connected to 4g and 5G and 2.4/5Ghz wifi", "The game doesn't have any sound anymore! I've checked the settings, Uninstalled the app, restarted my device. Every other game I have works fine except this one. Really sucks that suddenly the sound stopped working. Especially since I've bought the Premium battle pass upgrades. Hopefully thedevelopers can help me with this, otherwise I feel let down I've spent so much money on this app.", 'This game is really amazing! The game is overall really enjoyable. But there are some things that could be improved about the battlepass. Maybe make the battlepass less pay to win, IDEA:maybe make it so that you can buy the premium pass with 5000 gold, or you can buy it with real life money. And the last suggestion is make the daily missions easier for players with lvl 15+ otherwise, keep up the great work!!! 👍', 'I use to love this game, been playing it for over 6 months. But the new changes are all money grabs. The daily missions are way too difficult, would take you hours to complete each day. Prices keep going up for ships, so saving gold is useless, by the time you save up, they will just increase the price.', 'Overall a "good" naval game available in the store. It has some pro\'s & con\'s in comparison with other famous naval games. The pro\'s; good graphics, quick matches, and "free toplay" possible. The con\'s: you might get bored after a few matches as there is only one type of battle (elimination matches), it takes a lot of grinding to raise your level. As it is an arcade game, I still do not prefer when the deck guns on the ship is able to do a 360° fire arc as the ships are not supposed to.', 'The game\'s good, but I wish you\'d add deathmatch, so daily missions will be easier to fulfill, since there you won\'t have to worry about killstealing players/bots. Or, you can still get a half kill point for assist, since you did assist the player/bot to sink the opponent ship in the daily missions. Also, I wish you can add the XB-70 "Valkyrie" and the F-117 "Nighthawk" (please not in battle pass) Thank you, and I hope you can add more features in the game!', "Excellent game. Excellent graphics. Easy controls and easy to progress in ships and weaponry, without paying. Really doesn't seem to be a pay to play game. The only annoyance I've had so far, is the game timer. Just make the match go until one team is annihilated. It takes a long time for the teams to meet, which takes away from the time. A lot of times, I'm inbattle with the final ship and the match ends, because the timer runs out. Hope y'all will make that change.", "Overall amazing game! It's veryfriendly to newbies and veterans alike. It feels real rewarding when you finally pull off that 4-5 kill game and you credit count reflects that! Nothing feels as if it's locked behind a paywall. 1 suggestion though. Please allow us to land the planes and helis when they are deployed. This would make gameplay a little less stressful when you are throwing your aircraft at the enemy in a final stand at the beginning of the game. Thank you!", "A wonderfully done game which sets itself apart from its competition by tapping into the modern era. It is designed with excellent graphics and UI and is easy to pickup and move through the ranks with no grindy progression system but the time to the tier three ships is too long to keep interested. But other than that it's an excellent quality game.", 'When I first downloaded the game, kinda thought it was gonna be bad reading the reviews, but once I downloaded it. MAN, I was hit hard. Most games these days are low effort pay2win reskinned games, but this was good, its a little hard to progress to better ships like carriers and subs. But there is a variety of different items and ship loadouts that theres always something new to try. I would recommend this to my friends, only thing I want is to make progression a bit faster. Great game.', "The only thing i would critisize is that when submarines are submerged, they are lit up making it so easy to hunt down. Though it makes it easy for other players, its frustrating for the oerson olaying as a submarine. I'd like to have it so its harder for a submarine to be seen or have a minimal distance for it to be seen instead of all the time when under the water. Other than that its a fantastic game. Keep up the great work developers and i'll you out there captians.", "Just this evening, I tried to open the game. Suddenly its said that I have no internet connection. I have re-installed the app, and still act the same. I presume that the MW's server is down for awhile. Hopefully can fix in a blink. With that said, overall game is excellent. The background music is epic. Controls are easy. Well done the developers. Just make that bug or the problem fixed and I'll continue to play and watch those ads. Edited: App now can run well again. Thank you.", "Amazing game. I can see the developers really made a huge effort in this game. Everything about the aspect is just perfect. The movement, the graphics, the sound effects, etc. The only additions I would to like for the devs to add are (if it's feasible): -for carriers, have a separate supply line between the user and allied AI planes, as the AI always seem to take all the supplies before I have the chance to take supplies. -all ships have a voice language corresponds to their nationality.", "The game is great the one thing that needs improvements and reworking is the collision alert it should just appear on the HUD on the opposite side of the spotting indicator since sometimes you can't see it cause your finger is in the way. Instead it should show up as an alert like the spotting indicator but with a distance indicator and an arrow pointed at where the ship might crash. New suggestion, pls adddifferent shell types from semi-armor piercing, Hi-Explosive, HE- Airbursting ammo.", 'The game experience is great! Not much concerns in-game,but I do have a problem. I accidentally linked the wrong Google Play account onto my game progress, and I am unable to unlink it, so I was wondering if it is possible to add a change/remove/unlink account option for the log-in methods/progress backup options without compromising in-gameprogress. Other than that, Modern Warships is a well-made naval warfare game, graphics, mechanics, systems and all!', 'The game is great and enjoyable, I used to play before, months after the release and just comeback now. It\'s good to see that there are many updates since then that made the game more enjoyable. The only problem that I experience was the occasional "Warning" after the games and it said that it may be due to "Internet problem". And because of that, the money, gold, and mission tasks that I should have were not given. Well, it is tolerable if its just occasional, but it happened to me once for 5x.', "Too enjoyable to play, controls are straight forward, and lots of ships to play with varied in classes. Unfortunately right now after the new patch, the game is quite unstable before I can play with high settings and other tweaks in settings but I currently toned it down nearly lowest graphics cause frames drops dramatically especially on certain areas on the map. Overall, too good for a phone game, worth investing some money. Can't enjoy the eyecandy graphics on recent update though😅.", "I really love the game. I hope the developers will put some effort in underwater gameplay because many use submarines. Sub users cannot enjoy being underwater because it's too dark. We can only rely on the radar to avoid collisions and locate enemies. I hope the developers will, at least, lighten up the view underwater.", "Best warship game I've ever played! Very Good graphics , easy to control , good game performance and so much details. It's very cheap to download, only 700 MB, you can get very very good and realistic graphics. But there is a something that I don't really like. Matchmaking sometimes unfair and unplayable. Anyways, it's very fun game !", 'My experiences yes i really like it. Well in other words you better add this feature survival mode,improve the AI from offline mode plus changing difficulty of AI and challenge mode almost forgot add some story mode like about back story of the ships. If you add any of these features al tell more about my experiences.', "What happened to graphic, have to play as lowest setting and still have performance issue while I played as high grpahics before the update. Don't fix it of it is not broke dummy. Edit: My device is RAM 6GB and I played with High Graphics, Medium Water, All other effece turned on except Post processing. Right now after the update, I can't play with lowest setting and also turned off all the other effect.", "Since the new update can't play. Just keeps crashing. After playing the game for so long with a few different ships upgrades done a lot of different types of weapons & aircraft & then 1 upgrade & I can't play. Great game, graphics, selections of ships & weapons to just being not able to play. Needs a big fix.", 'I am freakin loving this game, the graphics, thegame, all perfect, but i think its a little to much for the aircraft ace combat control turning. Even if we move a little of the joystick, it manuvers massively, can you guys fix this please, thankyou Edit: so I think the ace combat control doesnt need ro be fixed, I think its already good, so dont change it', "Excellent game. But i want to give some suggestions 1. Thr empty aircraft carrier during battlee doesn't look realistic, just add demo aircrafts on the carrier, we can use just the 3 squadron at a time no problem with that, just add aircraft on carrier for show.2. The skins of the ships are not good, they are just miserable, add some new skins. 3. Add some new variety of maps as well with some real life location"],
